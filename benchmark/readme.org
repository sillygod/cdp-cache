* How to run
  
These benchmarks are borrowed from [[https://github.com/nicolasazrak/caddy-cache][here]] for comparision.

#+begin_src sh
  bash provision.sh
#+end_src

This will move the test data to the directory which will be served by Caddy. Then, run your caddy with the Caddyfile provided by benchmark.

#+begin_src sh
  caddy run --config [benchmark's Caddyfile]
#+end_src
