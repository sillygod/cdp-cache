Comments on the Taxonomic Status of Apodemus peninsulae, with
Description of a New Subspecies from North China

BY

J. KNOX JONES, JR.


In the past several years the United States National Museum has received
a large number of mammals from central and southern Korea through the
auspices of the Commission on Hemorrhagic Fever of the Armed Forces
Epidemiological Board. Among these Korean collections are more than a
hundred specimens of a murine rodent originally described as "_Micromys
speciosus peninsulae_" by Oldfield Thomas but currently placed in the
genus _Apodemus_. In attempting to ascertain the specific relationships
of this mouse I have examined, through the generosity of Dr. David H.
Johnson, Acting Curator of Mammals, most of the other Oriental specimens
of the subgenus _Sylvaemus_ in the U. S. National Museum and it is on
this combined material that the following comments and description are
based.

Three general groups of the genus _Apodemus_ are presently known to
occur on the mainland of northeast Asia. One is the distinctive
_Apodemus agrarius_, lone representative of the subgenus _Apodemus_. The
others, both in the subgenus _Sylvaemus_ and closely resembling each
other, are represented by a small animal that is currently regarded as
conspecific with _Apodemus sylvaticus_ and a larger animal of which the
Korean mouse, _peninsulae_, is representative. The oldest trivial name
applied to the large _Sylvaemus_ is _major_ of Radde, 1862, in the
combination [_Mus sylvaticus_] vrt. _major_. This is, however, twice
preoccupied (see Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951:566). The next
available name is _peninsulae_ of Thomas, 1907, which was applied to
mice from central and southern Korea (type from Mun'gyong, 110 mi. SE
Seoul, Korea), and was originally proposed as a subspecies of the
insular Japanese species, _Apodemus speciosus_. G. M. Allen (1940:949),
who recognized _peninsulae_ as a monotypic species, was the first
investigator to make the important distinction that it was not
conspecific with the Japanese _speciosus_, although Hollister (1913:1-2)
and Miller (1914:89) had previously used the combination _Apodemus
peninsulae_, evidently with the same thought in mind.

[Illustration: FIG. 1. Ventral views of skulls and left maxillary
tooth-rows of two species of the genus _Apodemus_.

_b._ _Apodemus flavicollis flavicollis_ (Melchior), Mauseklippe,
Germany, young [Male], No. 112895 USNM, ×10.

_d._ _Apodemus peninsulae peninsulae_ (Thomas), 6 mi. S Yongdongp'o,
Korea, adult [Male], No. 299554 USNM, ×2.

In comparing the ventral views of skulls note especially the size and
location of incisive foramina and posterior palatine foramina as well as
the breadth of mesopterygoid fossae. In comparing the left maxillary
tooth-rows note especially the size of M3 and the reduced
posterointernal cusp on Ml in _A. peninsulae_.]

More recently, Ellerman (1949:32) and Ellerman and Morrison-Scott
(1951:566) have arranged _peninsulae_ as a subspecies of _Apodemus
flavicollis_ under the assumption that all the members of the subgenus
_Sylvaemus_ on the eastern Asiatic mainland are subspecies of one or
another of the species of western Europe, _A. flavicollis_ or _A.
sylvaticus_. Ellerman (in Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951:564) states:
"The majority of the forms I distribute in a somewhat arbitrary manner
between _sylvaticus_, average smaller skull, and _flavicollis_, average
larger skull; occurring together nearly throughout the Palaearctic. I
feel fairly sure that there are some errors of judgment in my
arrangement, and equally sure that there is no other way to define
species in this very large and difficult group." I have compared the
specimens of _peninsulae_ available to me from central and southern
Korea with specimens of _A. f. flavicollis_ from Denmark, Germany and
Sweden and find, although the two are similar in many ways, that
_peninsulae_ differs from _flavicollis_ in several important characters:
Mammae 1-2=6 in _flavicollis_, and 2-2=8 in _peninsulae_; incisive
foramina reaching level of alveoli of M1, or nearly so, in
_flavicollis_, but ending conspicuously short of that level in
_peninsulae_; posterior palatine foramina large in _flavicollis_ and
opposite a point where M1 and M2 meet, but small in _peninsulae_ and
situated farther back on the palate, opposite M2. Moreover, _peninsulae_
lacks the characteristic buffy throat patch of _flavicollis_, has a much
reduced posterointernal cusp on the M1, a relatively (frequently
actually) larger M3 and, on the average, a broader mesopterygoid fossa.
In view of these differences, all of which appear to be constant, I
consider _peninsulae_ specifically distinct from _flavicollis_.
Throughout its known geographic range (see below) _peninsulae_ is
evidently confined to wooded terrain, either scrub or brush types or
forested areas, and the vernacular name wood mouse, therefore, seems
appropriate for this species.

The type specimens of _Apodemus praetor_ Miller (type from Sungari
River, 60 mi. SW Kirin, Manchuria) and _Apodemus nigritalus_ Hollister
(type from Tapucha, Altai Mountains, Siberia) agree with _peninsulae_ as
concerns the above characters and differ from it only in minor external
and cranial features. They are, therefore, here considered as subspecies
of the latter.

Ellerman (1949:32) and Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951:567) regarded
_nigritalus_, like _peninsulae_, as a subspecies of _flavicollis_. The
subspecies _praetor_, on the other hand, has generally been regarded as
a synonym of _peninsulae_ by recent authors. Howell (1929:58) noted that
the holotype was, "... a phenomenally large specimen such as is
encountered occasionally in almost all groups of rodents." He ascribed
the color differences noted by Miller to "seasonal" variation. The
holotype of _praetor_ is undeniably larger than the other adult
specimens listed in the original description. These paratypes and other
specimens of _praetor_ available to me are approximately the same size
externally and average only slightly larger cranially than specimens of
_peninsulae_ from central and southern Korea. However, the dorsal
coloration of _praetor_ is somewhat darker and duller than that of
_peninsulae_, especially in summer pelage when _praetor_ lacks the
conspicuous bright ochraceous tinge of the Korean specimens. In
addition, _praetor_ has broader zygomatic plates with correspondingly
deeper zygomatic notches and the color on the face of the upper incisors
averages much more orange than in _peninsulae_.

In the north then, wood mice range from Korea and Manchuria westward at
least as far as the Altai Mountains. For mice from the intervening
Siberian areas Russian workers have used the name _major_ which, as
noted above, is unavailable. The exact relationships of the mice of
these areas to previously named subspecies is unknown to me and I have
not seen specimens of "_Mus (Alsomys) major rufulus_" of Dukelsky, 1928,
the type locality of which is 75 versts (approximately 50 miles) SE
Vladivostok, Siberia. It appears to be of the same species as
_peninsulae_ and judging from the original description it closely
resembles _praetor_. Neither have I seen specimens of the Sakhalin
Island mouse, _giliacus_, which Ellerman (1949:32) regards as a
subspecies of _Apodemus sylvaticus_. I feel reasonably sure, however,
that it will prove to be a subspecies of _peninsulae_. In the original
description _giliacus_ was referred to as, "Most closely allied to the
Korean subspecies..." (Thomas, 1907:411).

In China the extent of the distribution of _Apodemus peninsulae_ is also
uncertain. Allen (1940:949-50) reported its occurrence from Jehol and
Hopeh in the northeast, southwestward through Shansi, Shensi and eastern
Kansu to Szechuan and northwestern Yunnan. Throughout most of this
region it occurs with another mouse, currently regarded as conspecific
with _Apodemus sylvaticus_, and the two kinds have been confused by some
previous authors. Howell (1929:58), for instance, reported twelve
specimens of _peninsulae_ from 65-75 mi. NE Peking but my examination of
these mice indicates that only four are _peninsulae_ while the others
are referrable to what is currently regarded as _Apodemus sylvaticus
draco_. Another subspecies of _sylvaticus_, _A. s. orestes_, occurs in
Szechuan and Yunnan and it is certain that some records of distribution
ascribed to _peninsulae_ from those provinces actually represent
_orestes_ (see Allen, 1940:949-50). _A. sylvaticus_ is distinguishable
from _peninsulae_ by darker ears, blackish preauricular patches, dark
eye rings, a noticeably smaller skull, incisive foramina that reach the
level of Ml (or nearly so), much larger auditory bullae, and a more
fully developed posterointernal cusp on M1. Too, _sylvaticus_ typically
has 1-2=6 mammae although Allen reports finding a 2-2=8 formula in some
specimens. _Apodemus latronum_, regarded as a full species by Osgood
(1932:318) and G. M. Allen (1940:950) but as a subspecies of
_flavicollis_ by Ellerman (1949:32) and Ellerman and Morrison-Scott
(1951:567), also occurs in Szechuan and Yunnan. Its relatively dark
color, large feet and large ears, _flavicollis_-like skull and large
molar teeth immediately separate it from _peninsulae_ although the two
possibly have been confused in the earlier literature. Until a complete
revisionary study of the Asiatic members of the subgenus _Sylvaemus_ can
be undertaken the presence of _peninsulae_ in southwestern China must
remain in question.

The western limits of the geographic range of _Apodemus peninsulae_ are
unknown. _Apodemus gurkha_ Thomas, 1924, from Nepal is said to have
2-2=8 mammae but the description is not otherwise suggestive of close
relationship to _peninsulae_. Farther to the west, _Apodemus flavicollis
rusiges_ Miller, 1913, from Kashmir seems to have been properly assigned
as a subspecies of _flavicollis_ (cotypes and large series in USNM).

Wood mice almost certainly do not occur in the Gobi Desert. They are
known as far west as the Altai Mountains to the north of the Gobi and at
least as far west as Kansu (see below) to the south of it. Whether the
geographic range of the species skirts the western edge of the arid
regions of northern China is at present unknown; perhaps it does not. At
any rate, mice available to me from the North Chinese provinces of
Jehol, Shansi, Shensi and Kansu are notably different in certain
external and cranial features from other known races of _Apodemus
peninsulae_ and are here given subspecific recognition. All measurements
are in millimeters. Capitalized color terms are from Ridgway (1912).

     _Type._--Adult female molting from winter to summer pelage, skin
     and skull, U. S. National Museum no. 175523, from 30 miles west of
     Kuei-hua-cheng, 7000 ft., northern Shansi, China; obtained on 23
     May 1912 by Arthur de Carle Sowerby, original no. 456.

     _Distribution._--Known presently from eastern Kansu eastward
     through Shensi, Shansi and Hopeh to southern Jehol, probably also
     in northeastern Szechuan, exact limits of range unknown.

     _Diagnosis._--Size small for species (see measurements). Color:
     Upper parts (fresh summer pelage) averaging near (15'_a_)
     Ochraceous-Buff, suffused with blackish (especially mid-dorsally);
     winter pelage much paler; underparts grayish-white, individual
     hairs plumbeous at base, tipped with white; ears pale brownish;
     feet whitish above, darker below; tail bicolor, pale brownish
     above, whitish below. Skull: Small (see measurements); rostrum
     somewhat shortened and conspicuously down-curved; zygomatic notches
     relatively shallow; zygomatic plates narrow; braincase
     proportionally more inflated than in other subspecies of the
     species; auditory bullae moderately inflated; upper incisors
     slender, their faces averaging bright yellowish-orange.

     _Measurements._--External measurements of the holotype, followed by
     those of an adult male and female from the type locality, are,
     respectively: Length of head and body, 101, 102, 100; length of
     tail, 93, ----, 102; length of hind foot (_su_), 21, 21.5, 23;
     length of ear from notch, 14, 16, 15.5. Corresponding measurements
     for an adult female from 20 mi. E Taiyuan, Shansi, are: 91, 99, 23,
     16. For cranial measurements see Table 1.

_Comparisons._--From _Apodemus peninsulae peninsulae_ (specimens from
various localities in central Korea), _A. p. sowerbyi_ differs in:
External size smaller throughout, especially hind foot; upper parts,
especially in summer pelage, and dorsal aspect of tail paler; skull
smaller and less massive; braincase proportionally more inflated;
rostrum shorter and noticeably down-curved. From _Apodemus peninsulae
praetor_ of Manchuria (holotype and paratypes), _A. p. sowerbyi_ differs
in most of the same ways in which it does from _peninsulae_ as well as
in having more shallow zygomatic notches, narrower zygomatic plates and
smaller, more slender, upper incisors. From _Apodemus peninsulae
nigritalus_ of the Altai Mountains of Siberia (holotype and paratypes),
_A. p. sowerbyi_ differs in: Smaller size, both external and cranial;
paler dorsal coloration; less convex cranial outline in lateral view;
smaller auditory bullae.

_Remarks._--_Apodemus peninsulae sowerbyi_ is named in honor of the late
Arthur de Carle Sowerby whose collections of mammals from North China
and Manchuria have added so much to our meager knowledge of that part of
the world.

Four specimens from Hsin-lung-shan, 65 mi. NE Peking, here assigned to
_sowerbyi_, are darker dorsally than mice from farther to the west and
in this respect may show approach to _A. p. praetor_. In all other
features, however, they closely resemble the new subspecies.

All of the specimens of _sowerbyi_ available to me are from altitudes of
3000 feet or higher. At lower elevations in North China, destruction of
wooded habitats owing to intense land-use practices has probably
restricted the distribution of _sowerbyi_ primarily to hilly and
mountainous areas where brushy, scrub and forest habitats still prevail.

     _Specimens examined._--Thirty-three, all from North China, as
     follows: JEHOL: Hsin-lung-shan, 65 mi. NE Peking, 3000 ft., 4.
     KANSU: 15 mi. S Lanchow, 7400 ft., 1. SHANSI: Chiao-cheng-shan, 90
     mi. W Taiyuan, 7000-8000 ft., 4; 30 mi. W Kuei-hau-cheng, 7000 ft.,
     5; Lung-wang-shan, 20 mi. E Taiyuan, 4000 ft., 10; 18 mi. W
     Taiyuan, 5000 ft., 1; 50 mi. NW Taiyuan, 5500 ft., 4. SHENSI: 12
     mi. S Yenan, 4000 ft., 4.

_Apodemus peninsulae_, then, is known or suspected to occur over much of
southeastern Siberia, Manchuria, Korea and North China. The western
limits of its geographic range are unknown. Over this vast area only
four subspecies, one newly named, can be ascribed with certainty to
_peninsulae_ whereas only two other kinds, _giliacus_ of Thomas from
Sakhalin and _rufulus_ of Dukelsky from extreme southeastern Siberia are
probably conspecific with it, the latter possibly a synonym of
_praetor_. These considerations underscore the preliminary nature of the
present paper. The mammalian fauna of northeastern Asia is scarcely
better known today than was that of North America in 1885 when Dr. C.
Hart Merriam organized what was later to become the U. S. Biological
Survey.

It seems to me that the correct names of four kinds of wood mice
discussed above are as follows:

_Apodemus peninsulae peninsulae_ (Thomas, 1907)
_Apodemus peninsulae nigritalus_ Hollister, 1913
_Apodemus peninsulae praetor_ Miller, 1914
_Apodemus peninsulae sowerbyi_ Jones, 1956

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
