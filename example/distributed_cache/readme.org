* Distributed Cache Example
  
  Note! It's still under development. A lot of issues are remained to be solved.


* Helper scripts
  
  To provision the test data with the one of the following two commands.
  
  #+begin_src sh
    PROJECT_PATH=/app docker-compose --project-directory=./ -f example/distributed_cache/docker-compose.yaml exec -w /app/provision cdp "bash provision.sh"
  #+end_src
  
  #+begin_src sh
    docker exec -w /app/benchmark cdp bash provision.sh
  #+end_src

  If you want to run an interactive shell for development, the following command will do it for you.
  #+begin_src sh
    PROJECT_PATH=/app docker-compose --project-directory=./ -f example/distributed_cache/docker-compose.yaml run -p9992:9991 --entrypoint="/bin/bash" cdp2
  #+end_src
